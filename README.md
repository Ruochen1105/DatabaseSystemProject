# DatabaseSystemProject

Final project for Fall 2023 CSCI-GA - 2433 Database Systems. The project includes a Python script to pre-process raw data downloaded from the web, a Python script to CRUD a cloud SQL database (Microsoft Azure SQL Cloud), and a pair of Python scipts that follow the client-server architecture, where the client collects information from the user and the server fits user data into pre-trained regression models to make predictions as recommendations.

## How to use

Make sure that all files are in the current working directory.

Keep the `server.py` running and run `client.py`.

## Notices
The original .csv files are not included due to the file size limitation of GitHub. The url for downloading the .csv files are included in the comment.

The configurations of my Microsoft Azure SQL server and database are not included for safety considerations. Please modify `credentials.py` before running the application.
