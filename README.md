Keep the `server.py` running and run `client.py`.

## Notices
The original .csv files are not included due to the file size limitation of Github. The url for downloading the .csv files are included in the comment.

The configurations of my Microsoft Azure SQL server and database are not included for safety considerations. Please modify `credentials.py` before running the application.
